## City_explorer_api

**Author**: Lesley Rivera
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
In labs 6 through 9, you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. You will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.

## Getting Started
- Locations: As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see data about the area of interest to me.
- As a user, I want to request current weather information so that I can learn more about the typical weather patterns in the location I had entered.
-  As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
- As a user, I want the application to provide properly formatted data so that I can view similar data for any location I choose.
- As a user, I want to enter the name of a location so that I do not need to look up the latitude and longitude every time I learn about a new location.
- As a user, I want to request current weather information at any location, so that I can learn more about the typical weather patterns in the area of interest.

## Architecture
- Node.js and npm 
- Express.js
- Superagent
